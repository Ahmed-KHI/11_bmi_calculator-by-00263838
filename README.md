Project Description: BMI Calculator

Project Title: Day 11: BMI Calculator

Description: This BMI Calculator is a user-friendly web application designed to help individuals calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight. The application provides instant feedback on BMI values and categorizes them to guide users in understanding their weight status.

Functionalities:

Input Fields: Users can input their height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms) through dedicated input fields.

BMI Calculation: The application computes the BMI using the formula: 

BMI
=
weight (kg)
height (m)
2
BMI= 
height (m) 
2
 
weight (kg)
​
 , where height is converted from centimeters to meters.
 
Result Display: Upon clicking the "Calculate" button, the application displays:

The calculated BMI value, rounded to one decimal place.

The corresponding BMI category, which can be "Underweight," "Normal," "Overweight," or "Obese," based on standard BMI classification ranges.

Error Handling: The application includes input validation to ensure that users enter positive values for both height and weight, providing clear error messages when necessary.

Technologies Used:

React for building the user interface.

Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design.

This project is part of a 30-day initiative aimed at enhancing programming skills through practical application development.
